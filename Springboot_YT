Coupling : refers to how closely connected different components
         or systems are

Types of Coupling :

i. Tight Coupling - describe a scenario where software components

are highly dependent on each other.


ii. Loose Coupling - describe a scenario where software components

are less dependent on each other. i.e. change in one component

minimal or no impact on the other component. This makes our system

much more flexible and easy to modify or extent.


======================================

Achieving Loose Coupling -

i. Interface and Abstraction
ii. Dependency Injection
iii. Event Driven Architecture

==============================================

IOC - 
so Instead of creating the object of the instance,  If spring framework somehow provide us the object during runtime .

so we have passed on the obj creation to spring framework, so the controlled is inverted. Hence know as IOC.


===============================================

Beans - objects that are managed by spring framework are known as 
        Beans.


===============================================


Spring Container -  manages the creation, management of object
of your spring application.

If you have your application running we might want spring to manage our objects, and so spring with the help of spring container manages the objects.

Entire lifecycle of objects is managed by spring container.


===============================================

Types of Spring Container :

i. Application context
ii. Bean Factory

===============================================

Important Question -> 

We have spring container it manages all the object.

How Does the spring framework know which object to manage and the details of what to manage ?? who will tell spring container ??

Ans :: we as a developer are responsible to tell the spring container that we want to manager these objects with the help of configuration file.

we will have some  config define in our file that will be picked up by the spring framework. and with the help of that configuration file the 

spring container would know that these are the object that he need to manage and it will pick up those object and it will instantiate them and 

it will so everything that it needs to.

====================================================


Configuration file contain Bean Definition -

so if you want the object to be managed by spring framework you need to declare that particular object as a Bean.

====================================================


Application context - is an Interface in Spring representing the IOC 

container that manages the beans and the dependencies.


ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is an implementation of 

ApplicationContext - is responsible for setting up and configuring 

the spring container. 

It loads the context definition from the context file located in 
the class path.

=====================================================

DI : is a design patter used to achieve loose coupling between classes by removing the direct dependency instantiation from the dependent class itself.

Two Type of DI :

i. Constructor Injection
ii. Setter Injection
